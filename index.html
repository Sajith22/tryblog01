        <p> The Defence Committee, led by Mr Ellwood, is urging the government to hold an "honest" inquiry into the UK's departure from Afghanistan, which led to the return of the Taliban to power.

            The MPs' report warns the country is again becoming a haven for terrorists.
            
            They also say thousands of people eligible for evacuation to the UK are still living at risk in Afghanistan.
            
            Responding to the report, the government said it worked "tirelessly to safely evacuate as many people out of Afghanistan as possible".
            
            The Ministry of Defence spokesperson added: "We owe a debt of gratitude to Afghan citizens who worked for, or with, the UK armed forces in Afghanistan and to date we have relocated over 12,100 individuals under the scheme."
            
            The department estimates there are around 300 eligible Afghans plus their families whom it is still trying to locate to bring back to the UK.
            
            It added it would respond fully to the MPs' report in due course.  </p>
